# Alluvian - Congestion Relief System
Making Roads Great Again.

Making the world's most liveable city an even better place to live - one road at a time, towards a more cleaner, greener and peaceful future.

## The Problem
Melbourne’s Traffic Congestion:
* Every day Melbourne’s traffic is getting more and more dense and now it is affecting travel times on our roads.
* Over 30 per cent of car trips occur in congested conditions.
* During peak hours Melbourne’s travel times can be increased by more than 60%.

## Root Cause
There are too many cars in Melbourne for the amount of people that are in the city.

## Findings
Based on our Market Research and Data Gathering:
* Making more roads doesn't really solve the problem.
* Reducing the number of people commuting to work daily does not change anything. 
* Better results are obtained when the amount cars used to commute daily are controlled.
* Doing nothing will only result in taking drastic actions in future.
* Building more transport infrastructure to fix road congestion without managing demand is financially and environmentally unsustainable.
* Pricing can spread demand, improve the efficiency and reliability of travel, reduce the costs of goods and services, reduce emissions and improve amenity.
    
## What if it could be solved?
You can not remove congestion from the roads, but it can be reduced.

This is where our [solution](https://himeshravi.github.io/Alluvian/) comes in.
